### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a **PHP and Laravel** developer experience in building high-quality management software.

I have extensive experience in supporting and developing applications from scratch on the Laravel framework for existing businesses and start-ups. My experiences range from building management software with highly complex logic in the back-end to making friendly UI for the front-end.

I love to code, love to solve complex problems, whether it needs a long time or a short time.

My skills include but not limited to:
- Back-end: PHP 5.*, 7.*, 8.*, Laravel 4.2, 5, 6, 7, 8;
-  Front-end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS, jQuery, TailwindCSS, Laravel Livewire;
-  Databases: MySQL,  Oracle, REDIS;
-  Solid understanding and OOP usage and design patterns;
-  Building and integrating RESTful APIs;
-  Unit testing, Feature testing;
-  Stripe integration, Quickbook integration;
-  Social login integration;

I am very interested to contribute on open source project. Let's connect and explore how we can create meaningful impact together.
